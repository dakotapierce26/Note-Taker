# Note Taker Starter Code
This one really stumped me and I ended up having to turn it in as is due to pilling up of other duties. My biggest battle with this is Heroku. I am not sure if I am using it incorrectly, however I plan to do more research on it and figure it out so I can revisit this project in the future! However, I am really feeling like I am getting the hang of Express and how it operates and npms in general as well!
